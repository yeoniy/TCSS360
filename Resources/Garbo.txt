Joan Pujol Garcia (Catalan; Spanish: Juan Pujol García), MBE (14 February 1912 – 10 October 1988) 
deliberately became a double agent during World War II, known by the British codename Garbo and 
the German codename Arabel.[2] Pujol had the distinction of being one of the few people – if not 
the only one – to receive decorations from both sides during World War II, gaining both an Iron
Cross from the Germans and an MBE from the British. After developing a loathing of both the 
Communist and Fascist regimes in Europe during the Spanish Civil War, Pujol decided to become
 a spy for the Allies as a way to do something "for the good of humanity".[3] Pujol and his 
wife[4] contacted the British and American intelligence agencies, but each rejected his offer. 
Undeterred, he created a false identity as a fanatically pro-Nazi Spanish government official 
and successfully became a German agent. He was instructed to travel to Britain and recruit
 additional agents; instead he moved to Lisbon and created bogus reports from a variety of 
public sources, including a tourist guide to England, train timetables, cinema newsreels, 
and magazine advertisements.[5] Although the information would not have withstood close 
examination, Pujol soon established himself as a trustworthy agent. He began inventing 
fictional sub-agents who could be blamed for false information and mistakes. The Allies
 finally accepted Pujol when the Germans spent considerable resources attempting to hunt down 
a fictional convoy.[6] The family was moved to Britain and Pujol was given the code name Garbo.
 Pujol and his handler Tomás (Tommy) Harris spent the rest of the war expanding the fictional 
network, communicating at first by letter, later by radio. Eventually the Germans were funding
 a network of twenty-seven fictional agents. Pujol had a key role in the success of Operation 
Fortitude, the deception operation intended to mislead the Germans about the timing and location 
of the invasion of Normandy near the end of the war. The false information Pujol supplied helped
 persuade German intelligence that the main attack would be in the Pas de Calais, keeping two 
armoured divisions and 19 infantry divisions there for two months after the Normandy invasion.[1]
Pujol was born in the Catalan city of Barcelona, Spain on 14 February 1912[7] 
(or possibly 28 February 1912)[8] to Juan Pujol, a Catalan who owned a factory that produced dye, 
and Mercedes Guijarro Garcia, from the Andalusian town of Motril in the Province of Granada.[8][9]
 The third of four children, Pujol was sent at age seven to the Valldemia boarding school[10] run
 by the Marist Brothers[11] in Mataró, twenty miles from Barcelona; he remained there for the next
 four years. The students were only allowed out of the school on Sundays if they had a visitor, so
 his father made the trip every week.His mother came from a very strict Catholic family who took 
communion every day,[12] but his father was much more secular and had liberal political beliefs.[13] 
At age thirteen, he transferred to a school in Barcelona run by his father's card-playing friend[14] 
Father Mossen Josep, where he remained for three years.[14] After an argument with a teacher, he 
decided that he no longer wished to remain at the school, and became an apprentice at a hardware 
store.Pujol engaged in a variety of occupations prior to and after the Spanish Civil War, such as
studying animal husbandry at the Royal Poultry School in Arenys de Mar and managing various
 businesses, including a cinema.[13][14][15][16][17] His father died a few months after the Second 
Republic's birth in 1931, while Pujol was completing his education as a poultry farmer.[18] Pujol's 
father left his family well-provided for, until his father's factory was taken over by the workers, 
around the Spanish Civil War's start.[13]
